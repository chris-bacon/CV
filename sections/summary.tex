\section{Summary}

I am an experienced software engineer who has worked on a range of different domains, problems, and technologies. My main focus throughout my career has been on excellence and best practices â€“ both cultural and engineering.\\

During my time at the BBC and Tracsis, I have encouraged and helped others on my team to write well-tested code through a process of TDD, as well as encouraging good development practices through functional programming design patterns. I have been instrumental in shaping and forming positive team culture and engineering best practices, and have taken lead on projects critical to the success of the enterprise; such as, driving out the CI/CD pipeline for the newly created Universal App Platform, promoting feature-toggle based development to enable a smoother continuous delivery process, and introducing pair programming to the engineering department at Tracsis, improving collaboration and increasing collective ownership and shared knowledge of the code, thus greatly reducing risk and cost of new feature development.

I am committed to helping the team write software as a harmonised and unified whole as I view software as fundamentally a team enterprise, and I am a strong believer in the value of XP. This involves a strong emphasis on pair/mob programming and including all disciplines in the software-creation process as early as possible, coupled with expert knowledge of the technologies involved.\\

I have also given a number of talks in-house, at the BBC and Tracsis, and externally, and I enjoy building serverless applications in my spare time, using services such as AWS Lambda.\\
