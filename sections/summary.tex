\section{Summary}

I am an experienced software engineer who has worked on a range of different domains, problems, and technologies. My main focus throughout my career has been on engineering excellence and best practices – both for software and the teams I have been a part of.\\

During my time at the BBC and Tracsis, I have encouraged and helped others on my team to write well-tested code through a process of TDD, as well as encouraging good development practices through functional programming design patterns. Moreover, at Tracsis I have promoted and helped my team practice feature-toggle based development, where each new feature is locked behind a feature-toggle to enable a smoother continuous delivery process. I also successfully introduced pair programming to my team at Tracsis, which had not practised pair programming until that point. This helped increase collective ownership and shared knowledge of the code, which greatly reduced risk and cost of new feature development. Through sprint planning meetings I have also encouraged the team to take a more Kanban-based approach to visualise work-in-progress, as well as other best practices, such as committing small and often, to help improve the CI/CD process. I have also spent time improving the CI pipeline at Tracsis – on one occasion improving the speed of the selenium jobs by around 25\% - and been a proponent of more automation and a fully fledged CD process.\\

I am committed to helping the team write software as a harmonised and unified whole as I view software as fundamentally a team enterprise, and I am a strong believer in the value of XP. For me this involves a strong emphasis on pair/mob programming and including all aspects of the (dev and non-dev) team in the software-creating process as early as possible, coupled with expert knowledge of the technologies involved.\\

I have also given a number of talks in-house, at the BBC and Tracsis, and externally, and I enjoy building serverless applications in my spare time, using services such as AWS Lambda.\\
